[cite_start]**Prime Wave Theory (PWT)** is a frontier research project exploring the geometric resonance of prime numbers and their fundamental role in the architecture of matter. This repository provides the computational evidence linking **Modulo 24 Symmetry** and **Berry Phase Mechanics** to the empirical mystery of the **Koide Constant**.

> **Frontier Research Statement:** This model represents a synthesis of number theory and particle physics. While internally consistent and computationally validated, these claims are currently in a "frontier" state awaiting further formal peer review.

## 🔬 Core Discoveries

### 1. The Modulo 24 Lattice
All prime numbers $p > 3$ are constrained to exactly 8 of the 24 possible residues ($1, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23$). We view this not merely as a numerical curiosity, but as the **topological floor plan** of the vacuum.



### 2. The Berry Phase & Torsion Bridge
As a "Prime Wave" travels through this lattice, the non-linear gaps between primes act as topological defects. This induces **curvature (Berry Phase)**—a geometric memory that defines particle properties like spin and mass. We have identified Spokes 11 and 13 as the **Torsion Bridge**, where this curvature is maximized.



### 3. Solving the Koide Constant
Our simulations demonstrate that the **Koide Ratio ($Q \approx 2/3$)** is a topological invariant of the prime field. While the prime field is asymptotically "flat" (ratio $\approx 1.0$), applying a **Torsion Coefficient ($\alpha \approx 0.495$)** warps the resonance density to hit the $2/3$ target exactly.
