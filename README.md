[cite_start]**Prime Wave Theory (PWT)** is a frontier research project exploring the geometric resonance of prime numbers and their fundamental role in the architecture of matter. This repository provides the computational evidence linking **Modulo 24 Symmetry** and **Berry Phase Mechanics** to the empirical mystery of the **Koide Constant**.

> **Frontier Research Statement:** This model represents a synthesis of number theory and particle physics. While internally consistent and computationally validated, these claims are currently in a "frontier" state awaiting further formal peer review.

## 🔬 Core Discoveries

### 1. The Modulo 24 Lattice
All prime numbers $p > 3$ are constrained to exactly 8 of the 24 possible residues ($1, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23$). We view this not merely as a numerical curiosity, but as the **topological floor plan** of the vacuum.



### 2. The Berry Phase & Torsion Bridge
As a "Prime Wave" travels through this lattice, the non-linear gaps between primes act as topological defects. This induces **curvature (Berry Phase)**—a geometric memory that defines particle properties like spin and mass. We have identified Spokes 11 and 13 as the **Torsion Bridge**, where this curvature is maximized.



### 3. Solving the Koide Constant
Our simulations demonstrate that the **Koide Ratio ($Q \approx 2/3$)** is a topological invariant of the prime field. While the prime field is asymptotically "flat" (ratio $\approx 1.0$), applying a **Torsion Coefficient ($\alpha \approx 0.495$)** warps the resonance density to hit the $2/3$ target exactly.



### 3. Rational Prime-Mirror Resonance in Analog Circuits
**Rational Prime-Mirror Resonance in Analog Circuits**: From Discrete Quantum Arithmetic to the Hardware Koide ConstantCurrent physics utilizes imaginary numbers (i) for oscillation, which we argue obscures foundational rational reality. We advocate for a discrete, rational alternative using maxel theory and harmonic analysis. This study tests the Prime-Mirror hypothesis and evaluates hardware coherence through the lens of PWT (Prime Wave Theory) and Koide-like mass relations.

## 💻 Simulations
| Script | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `mod24_wheel.py` | Visualizes the 8-spoke prime lattice constraint. |
| `resonance_bridge.py` | Maps PWT nodal peaks against the Koide mass zones. |
| `event_horizon.py` | Scales analysis up to $10^6$ primes to test field "flatness". |
| `prime_torsion.py` | Models the geometric twist required to derive the $2/3$ ratio. |
| `rational_prime_mirror-v4.py` | Model that validates rational 'quantum' framework where prime numbers order the microcosm (1/p) and macrocosm (p/1), with 1/1 as the transitional boundary. |
| `hybrid_pwt_plaquette_bridge_v14.py` | A hybrid simulation, hardware-derived delays were used to compute torsion weighted densities (α). While idealized software reaches Qℓ = 0.667, the breadboard implementation stabilized at a distinct fixed point.. |

## 🤝 Collaboration
We are currently refining the **$\alpha \approx 0.495$** coefficient to establish its origin in first-principles topology.

## 💻 Refined Simulations
| Script | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `multipolar_torsion_engine.py` | This Python module is designed to be integrated directly into the prime_torsion.py core of the Prime Wave Lab. It replaces the empirical constant α=0.495 with a deterministic Multipolar Torsion Engine derived from the constants of nature. |
| `muon_torsion_engine.py` | This block of script shows how the Torsion Bridge handles the mass hierarchy shift. |
| `tau_torsion_engine.py` | This code completes the set and calculates the final Torsion Bridge value for the Tau. |
| `PWT_Final_Verification.py` | This Verification Script is designed to be our definitive numerical anchor. It consolidates every high-precision constant and formula we have derived into a single, executable record. Running this script will produce a "Clean Room" validation of the Unified Torsion Formula for our files. |
