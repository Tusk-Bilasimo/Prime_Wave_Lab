# Wiki Sub-Page: Glossary of Terms

This glossary defines the specialized terminology of **Prime Wave Theory (PWT)** and maps these concepts to established principles in theoretical physics and number theory.

### **1. Geometric & Topological Terms**

-   **Modulo 24 Symmetry (The Base Space)**: The foundational observation that all prime numbers p>3 are restricted to 8 specific residues: 1,5,7,11,13,17,19,23. In PWT, this is considered the topological "floor plan" of the vacuum.
    
-   **Prime Plaquette**: The fundamental geometric unit or "tile" of the numerical field, defined by the area between four (or three) prime coordinates.
    
-   **Triangular Plaquette Torsion**: The structural warping of minimal three-sided units. The triangle's 3 sides define an "inside" and "outside" domain, creating an inherent 2/3 relationship even before numerical distribution.
    
-   **Torsion Bridge**: The specific region on the Mod-24 wheel (Spokes 11 and 13) where prime gaps induce maximum geometric curvature.
    

  

-   **24-Cell Honeycomb**: A 4D regular polychoron whose 2D projection is the Modulo 24 wheel. Primes act as the nodal points of this honeycomb, defining the architecture of spacetime.
    

  

-   **Topological Charge (Prime Defect)**: The property of a prime number acting as a "singularity" or "knot" in the rational number field that cannot be smoothed out without changing the system.
    

  
  

### **2. Physical & Wave Mechanics Terms**

-   **Berry Phase (Geometric Phase)**: A topological "memory" retained by a wave after a cyclic evolution. In PWT, the "cycle" is the Mod-24 rotation; the phase shift is dictated by the prime gaps passed over.
    
-   **Holonomy**: The mathematical measure of how a vector's orientation shifts when moved around a closed loop (Plaquette) on a curved surface.
    

  

-   **Fermion Spin (720° Derivation)**: The proposal that particle spin is a result of Möbius-like topology. If a prime wave picks up a phase shift of π (180°) in one cycle, it requires two full rotations (720°) to return to its original state.
    

  

-   **Resonance Pressure**: The intensity of the prime field at specific nodal points. PWT suggests that what we perceive as "Mass" is the resonance pressure exerted by prime waves at topological hinges.
    

  
  

### **3. Computational & Algebraic Terms**

-   **Maxel Algebra**: The computational framework used to measure the "Spread" (distance) and "Intensity" (density) of prime numbers within the resonance field.
    

  
  

-   **Torsion Coefficient (α)**: An adjustable parameter used to model the "geometric twist" or field curvature required to align numerical data with physical constants.
    

  

-   **The Golden Torsion (α≈0.495)**: The specific coefficient value found to warp the prime resonance density to hit the **Koide Target (2/3)** exactly at high prime limits.
    

  

-   **Event Horizon Scanner**: A diagnostic script that tests the stability of geometric ratios across expanding magnitudes of prime numbers (e.g., 102 to 107).
