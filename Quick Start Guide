## Overview
Welcome to the **Prime Wave Lab**. This repository provides the computational framework to explore the "Event Horizon" where number theory bridges with the fundamental architecture of matter. By running these simulations, you can verify how prime distributions on a **Modulo 24** lattice generate the geometric curvature necessary for particle mass and spin.

## Prerequisites
To run these simulations, ensure you have Python 3.x installed along with the required numerical and visualization libraries:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib seaborn

  The Simulation Suite
1. Visualizing the Base Space: mod24_wheel.py

This script generates the Modulo 24 Prime Sieve. It demonstrates that all primes p>3 are restricted to exactly 8 residues, which we define as the "topological floor plan" of the vacuum.
2. Identifying Resonance Peaks: resonance_bridge.py

This script maps Rational Resonance peaks against the Mod-24 wheel. It highlights the two critical Koide Zones:

    Zone L1 (Spokes 5 & 7): Associated with primary mass resonance.

    Zone L2 (Spokes 11 & 13): Known as the Torsion Bridge, where prime gaps induce maximum geometric curvature.

3. Scanning the Event Horizon: event_horizon.py

Utilizing Maxel Algebra, this scanner measures the "Resonance Pressure" (intensity) of the prime field as it scales toward 106.

    The Flat Field Benchmark: Without torsion, the resonance ratio between the zones remains approximately 1.0, confirming the field is "flat" according to Dirichlet's Theorem.

4. Bending the Field: prime_torsion.py

This simulation introduces the Torsion Coefficient (αα) to model the Berry Phase (topological memory) acquired by waves traversing the modular cycle.

    The Target: Adjust αα to observe the emergence of the Koide Ratio (2/3).

    Golden Torsion: Our research identifies α≈0.495α≈0.495 as the high-precision value required to hit the 0.6667 target at the 107 prime limit.

Key Interpretations
Concept	Prime Wave Equivalent	Physical Manifestation
Cyclic Path	The Modulo 24 wheel (1 to 25)	Periodic nature of the vacuum
Curvature	The non-linear "gaps" between primes	Gravity / Mass Density
Berry Phase	The phase shift after one Mod-24 cycle	Particle Spin
Plaquette	The triangular area between 3 prime nodes	Fundamental "unit" of matter
The 720° Spin Derivation

In these models, Fermion Spin is a direct consequence of prime topology. If a prime wave picks up a phase shift of ππ (180°) after one full rotation, it requires a second cycle—totalling 720∘720∘—to return to its original orientation.
