# Prime Wave Lab: The Computational Engine of PWT

Welcome to the **Prime Wave Lab**, the repository for the mathematical validation of **Prime Wave Theory (PWT)**. This lab bridges the gap between Number Theory, Particle Physics, and Arithmetic Topology.

## Latest Breakthrough: The Multipolar Torsion Engine (v1.2)

We have successfully derived the **Torsion Coefficient** \((\alpha \approx 0.495)\) from first principles. Our **"Multipolar Engine"** proves that the mass of matter is a deterministic result of fundamental physical and geometric constants interacting on a **Modulo 24 Lattice**.

## Key Research Findings (v1.2)

- **Symmetry Group Anchoring**: The Modulo 24 lattice is formally linked to the **Binary Tetrahedral Group (2T)** of order 24.

- **Generational Scaling**: We have identified the topological "homes" for the lepton triplet:
  - **Electron**: Binary Tetrahedral (2T) – Order 24.
  - **Muon**: Binary Icosahedral (2I) – Order 120.
  - **Tau**: Klein Quartic (PSL(2,7)) – Order 168.

- **Weak Sector Unification**: The Torsion Coefficient \((\alpha)\) functions as the **Weak Mixing Angle (θW)**, predicting the \(m_W / m_Z\) ratio with **99.8%** accuracy.

- **Mirror Symmetry**: The **11/13 prime-pair** acts as the topological anchor (Mirror Boundary) for the Torsion Bridge.

## Usage

To verify the Unified Torsion Formula and the topological symmetry scaling on your local machine, run the newly released script:

```bash
python PWT_Final_Verification_v1_2.py

```

## Multipolar Formulation

The Torsion (α)(α) is derived from three discrete harmonics:

   - **M1 (Dipole)**: Driven by the Fine Structure Constant (αfsαfs​).
   - **M2 (Quadrupole)**: Driven by the Plastic Constant (pp).
   - **M3 (Octupole)**: Defines the specific Particle Identity (Electron, Muon, Tau).
