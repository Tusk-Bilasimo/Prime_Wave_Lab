# ROADMAP: The Future of Prime Wave Theory

## Phase I: Foundation & Validation (Current)

-   **Establishment of the Mod-24 Lattice**: Solidify the 8-spoke symmetry as the primary topological constraint for all prime-based wave functions.
    
-   **Precision Torsion Fitting**: Refine the **Torsion Coefficient (α)** using high-magnitude data sets (up to 107 primes) to maintain the **Koide Target (2/3)**.
    
-   **Open Source Lab Launch**: Provide a verified, executable code base for peer review and collaborative testing.
    

## Phase II: Statistical Rigor & Mapping (Q1-Q2 2026)

-   **Bootstrap Resampling**: Implement statistical error bars and 95% confidence intervals to ensure the model remains robust against prime gap fluctuations.
    

-   **Mass-Density Correlation**: Map spoke densities directly to actual lepton masses (electron, muon, tau) as reported by the Particle Data Group (PDG).
    
-   **Holonomy Verification**: Formally calculate the **Berry Phase** integral across the Mod-24 cycle to mathematically derive the predicted 720° fermion spin.
    

## Phase III: First-Principles Derivation (Q3-Q4 2026)

-   **Geometric Origin of α**: Transition away from post-hoc fitting of α≈0.495 by deriving the coefficient from the topological density of a **24-cell honeycomb**.
    
-   **Triangular Plaquette Dynamics**: Formalize the 2/3 ratio as a result of the internal/external domain relationship within nature's minimal stable shape (the triangle).
    
-   **Cross-Wheel Generalization**: Test if the torsion model persists in other modular systems (e.g., Mod-30) to explain why 24-spoke geometry is unique to our 4D reality.
    

  

## Phase IV: Field Expansion (2027 & Beyond)

-   **Quark Extension**: Investigate if similar prime-based torsion models can be applied to the quark mass hierarchy.
    
-   **Gravitational Coupling**: Explore the relationship between **Resonance Pressure** and the curvature of spacetime (gravity).
    
-   **Universal Standing Wave Theory**: Publish a unified framework that defines the vacuum as a resonance output of a prime-based algorithm.
